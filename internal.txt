(It's an ugly, jumbled mess)
- Island rework:
	- Pick island "hub" rooms based on number of connections of visited room. Most wins. Number is based on reasonable sizes (e.g. 20 rooms to an island)
	- gradient pathfind and tag all rooms with the island of the closest hub
	- two(+) simulations:
		- macro simulation, arranges islands only (so they don't overlap)
		- island simulations, arranges items within an island
			- instead of using link forces and trying to keep things on certain sides, make a force function that calculates an "ideal" position and pulls toward that
				- adjust radii as we get farther from the hub so it's easier to fit "impossible" room arrangements


- Or, just go with only rendering nearby rooms for now?

- pathfinding

- Show roughly real room shapes
