	- dampen room moevement if it didn't just join?
	- the inward jutter some nodes experience when we add data. What's causing that?
	- stronger realtive positions next to user's room
	- other fixes?

- let rooms wanter in bubble
	- xx don't set room.fx/fy
	- need to deal with special drag stuff, maybe just have a different icon in the center of the island
	- use a force to still keep it somewhat centered


- why does Mines_34 only appear with spoilers off?! (With room-centric on Waterways_04)
	- might be glowing anything connected, even if transition not visible
- also, appears one-way transitions aren't being included going outward in player-centric view

- color unvisited doors
- missed item flag/icon

- where I died

- color recently taken transitions/rooms

- click to select,
	- pathfinding to selected room, https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.path looks like good lib for helping

- icons for rooms:
	- automatically mark: stations, benches, darkness, shops
	- user-applied icons
	- all doors used
	- all items collected

- times visited room?

- Fungus1_* is greenpath, fix coloring
- Special rooms:
	- Cinematic_Stag_travel is not a real room...
	- Fungus1_04 vs Fungus1_04_Boss weirdness?

- tangled mess: nbody negative force

- not stopping server causes hang on quit?






- Room link joints try to position to center of other room instead of its corresponding door
- Pathfinding to item in spoiler mode?
- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- zz Show real room icons

- show one-way transitions?
- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions


- Bugs
	- Doesn't work with fresh save file, have to exit and reload
	- reload page while save data is stale gives...stale save data  - seems to happen even if I pull data directly from the randomizer mod settings
