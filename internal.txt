- xx There's already a "RandoMap" for Hollow Knight, so should change name

- Integrate with real game
	- xx start web server
	- xx include assets
	- xx websockets
	- xx hook when player changes maps
	- xx push loaded save data
	- xx message when not in game
	- add rooms and such as we explore

- new transitions have their lines on top of items
- reload page while save data is stale gives...stale save data (pull directly from mod)
- it split to more islands too early?
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island




- Show real room icons

- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))

- pathfinding to room/item, https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.path looks like good lib for helping



- Button to rearrange to be user-centric

- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions


- Bugs
	- Doesn't work with fresh save file, have to exit and reload
