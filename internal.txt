(It's an ugly, jumbled mess)

- xx try different ways of aligning rooms
- nn It's still a jumbled mess, table that for now and move on.

- size island based on number of nodes

- Dynamically add new (visible) nodes works

- Button to rearrange to be user-centric
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- Toggle memory mode vs guide mode

- pathfinding to room/item, https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.path looks like good lib for helping

- Integrate with real game

- Show real room icons

- Jumbled mess
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions
