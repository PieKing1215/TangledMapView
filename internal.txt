Next

- xx websocket-sharp dependency

- stronger relative positions next to user's room
- things that aren't "close" to our current room shouldn't appear close visually

- color door we used to enter
- color recently taken transitions/rooms

- icons for rooms

- search rooms by name
- search rooms by icon

- mark shade room

- logic-based routing

Unsorted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


- where I died
	- and automatically draw a route to shade

- Room position stability:
	- dampen room moevement if it didn't just join?
	- the inward jutter some nodes experience when we add data. What's causing that?
	- stronger relative positions on "many connection" rooms
	- stronger/more distant repulsion to things we aren't graph close to
	- stay close to src room if dead end
	- align with doors instead of centers

- common rooms in room list by easy description (shops, black egg, grubs, mantis village, traitor's child grave, etc.)

- metadata
	- missed item flag/icon
	- times visited room?
	- maybe only after you have map for the area?


- icons for rooms:
	- automatically mark: transport (elevators, stations, tram, dram connection), benches, darkness, shops
	- user-applied icons
	- all doors used
	- all items collected
	- shade
	- dream warp

- routing 2.0:
	- one-way paths
	- add transport to map linkage
		- available stag stations
		- elevators
		- trams
		- current dream warp
		- dream warps to/from white palace
	- use randomizer's logic to plan routes

- Spoilers: give hint
	- next in progression or specific item, save to a log

- travel history?

- In-game maps reveal info
	- Show grub locations when you have the collector's map
	- Area maps: show all rooms for area, and transitions between rooms that we have maps for)
	- bonus: show where you are in a room when you have wayward compass equipped

- pathfind to nearest mark of given type

- based on route, could show an in-game arrow pointing to the target transition in question

- not stopping server causes hang on quit?
	- maybe need to nuke websocket connections?


- put the options in a "hamburger" menu if we are on a small display device?


- Pathfinding to item in spoiler mode?
- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- is falling out of the blue heart challenge room to warp considered by logic?

- show one-way transitions?

- works with not-full-room-rando modes

- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions

- "this direction dead-ends soonest" hints?

- Bugs
	- Doesn't work with fresh save file, have to exit and reload
	- reload page while save data is stale gives...stale save data  - seems to happen even if I pull data directly from the randomizer mod settings

- User feedback:
	- forgot dependency for websockets
	- one user: hit the new save file bug, and found it to kill game performance on another monitor
