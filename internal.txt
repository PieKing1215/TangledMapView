	- dampen room moevement if it didn't just join?
	- the inward jutter some nodes experience when we add data. What's causing that?
	- stronger realtive positions next to user's room
	- other fixes?


- why does Mines_34 only appear with spoilers off?! (With room-centric on Waterways_04)
	- might be glowing anything connected, even if transition not visible
	- delete data.visitedDoors["Crossroads_09[right1]"]; delete data.visitedDoors["Waterways_04[left1]"]; app.enterRoom("Deepnest_East_06")
		hover Crossroads_09, observe Waterways_04 glow
- xx also, appears one-way transitions aren't being included going outward in player-centric view
	- see Deepnest_01b top center transition in b4 file

- missed item flag/icon

- where I died
	- and automatically draw a route to shade

- color recently taken transitions/rooms

- select another room
	- click to select
	- or use search
		- error if not seen
	- highlight it
	- pathfinding to selected room, https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.path looks like good lib for helping
		- or no route found

- icons for rooms:
	- automatically mark: stations, benches, darkness, shops
	- user-applied icons
	- all doors used
	- all items collected

- times visited room?


- tangled mess: nbody negative force

- not stopping server causes hang on quit?






- Room link joints try to position to center of other room instead of its corresponding door
- Pathfinding to item in spoiler mode?
- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- zz Show real room icons

- show one-way transitions?
- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions


- Bugs
	- Doesn't work with fresh save file, have to exit and reload
	- reload page while save data is stale gives...stale save data  - seems to happen even if I pull data directly from the randomizer mod settings
