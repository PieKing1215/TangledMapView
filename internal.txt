	- dampen room moevement if it didn't just join?
	- the inward jutter some nodes experience when we add data. What's causing that?
	- stronger relative positions next to user's room
	- stronger relative positions on "many connection" rooms
	- stronger/more distant repulsion to things we aren't graph close to
	- other fixes?



- metadata
	- missed item flag/icon
	- times visited room?
	- maybe only after you have map for the area?

- where I died
	- and automatically draw a route to shade

- color door we used to enter
- color recently taken transitions/rooms

- icons for rooms:
	- automatically mark: transport (elevators, stations, tram, dram connection), benches, darkness, shops
	- user-applied icons
	- all doors used
	- all items collected
	- shade
	- dream warp

- kill target room when we enter it

- routing 2.0:
	- add transport to map linkage
		- available stag stations
		- elevators
		- trams
		- current dream warp
		- dream warps to/from white palace
	- use randomizer's logic to plan routes


- not stopping server causes hang on quit?
	- maybe need to nuke websocket connections?

- Ruins2_03_boss isn't real (maybe anytime it's load additive?)



- Room link joints try to position to center of other room instead of its corresponding door
- Pathfinding to item in spoiler mode?
- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- zz Show real room icons

- show one-way transitions?
- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions


- Bugs
	- Doesn't work with fresh save file, have to exit and reload
	- reload page while save data is stale gives...stale save data  - seems to happen even if I pull data directly from the randomizer mod settings
