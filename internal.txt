(It's an ugly, jumbled mess)

- try different ways of aligning rooms

- try pulling more related islands closer together, maybe

- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
	- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions

- Or, just go with only rendering nearby rooms for now?

- pathfinding to room/item, https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.path looks like good lib for helping

- Show roughly real room shapes
