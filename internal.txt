- xx FPS saver
- @routing 2.0
- xx highlight selected room even if no route

Unsorted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- icons for rooms
- mark shade room
	- PlayerData.instance.shadeScene
- color door we used to enter
- color recently taken transitions/rooms
- stronger relative positions next to user's room
- things that aren't "close" to our current room shouldn't appear close visually

- search rooms by name
- search rooms by icon

- show checks/possibleChecks save completion percentage

- remove "dist X, Y unvisted"

- where I died
	- and automatically draw a route to shade

- Room position stability:
	- dampen room moevement if it didn't just join?
	- the inward jutter some nodes experience when we add data. What's causing that?
	- stronger relative positions on "many connection" rooms
	- stronger/more distant repulsion to things we aren't graph close to
	- stay close to src room if dead end
	- align with doors instead of centers

- common rooms in room list by easy description (shops, black egg, grubs, mantis village, traitor's child grave, etc.)

- Little "?" next to items that explain what they do?

- metadata
	- missed item flag/icon
	- times visited room?
	- maybe only after you have map for the area?


- icons for rooms:
	- automatically mark: transport (elevators, stations, tram, dram connection), benches, darkness, shops
	- user-applied icons
	- all doors used
	- all items collected
	- shade
	- dream warp

- routing 2.0:
	- xx one-way paths
	- re-parse scenes:
		- xx include door destinations
			- xx which door on the destination?
		- xx positions of all items the randomizer may fiddle with
		- xx which randomizer area a room is in

		- xx benches and locations
		- some doors don't have directly set destinations, just add hardcoded overrides

	- render map w/out randomization

	- show check instead of rotated square when you get an item?

	- add transport to map linkage
		- available stag stations
		- elevators
		- trams
		- current dream warp
		- dream warps to/from white palace
	- how to handle "Boss_Essence-Marmu" and friends that have their item in a different scene in the same room?
		- maybe just detect and shunt read data to roomId?
	- use randomizer's logic to plan routes
	- option
		- to do benchwarp from current pos
		- to try to avoid path of pain
	- view layout that linearizes your selected route

- Spoilers: give hint
	- See: JSON.parse(data.saveData.PolymorphicModData.RandomizerMod).StringValues._orderedLocations
	- next in progression or specific item, save to a log
- Button to select a nearby room with unvisited transition

- travel history?

- In-game maps reveal info
	- Show grub locations when you have the collector's map
	- Area maps: show all rooms for area, and transitions between rooms that we have maps for)
	- bonus: show where you are in a room when you have wayward compass equipped

- pathfind to nearest mark of given type

- based on route, could show an in-game arrow pointing to the target transition in question

- not stopping server causes hang on quit?
	- maybe need to nuke websocket connections?


- put the options in a "hamburger" menu if we are on a small display device?


- Pathfinding to item in spoiler mode?
- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- is falling out of the blue heart challenge room to warp considered by logic?

- show one-way transitions?

- works with not-full-room-rando modes

- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions

- "this direction dead-ends soonest" hints?

- move room name (and stats if any) to bottom of screen or to info box or something

- maybe show where you are and your target is, if offscreen (little this-a-way arrows)

- maybe better room search? If you know you want a stag but not which room

- Notes on split rooms:
	- Soul master
	- that one in White Palace
	- Deepnest_East_07
	- that one in the city
	- Fungus3_44

- goals
	- checkboxes for common goals: any%, grubs, pantheon, 112%, moth evaportaion
	- show status toward each goal (e.g. 5/46 grubs, 2/3 dreamers, boss count and which you do/don't have)
		- maybe just always show that stuff?
		- can show "randomizer percent" too (num checks/cleared checks)
	- give hint button skips things that aren't in your goals

- Bugs
	- Doesn't work with fresh save file, have to exit and reload
	- reload page while save data is stale gives...stale save data  - seems to happen even if I pull data directly from the randomizer mod settings

- User feedback:
	- xx forgot dependency for websockets
	- hit the new save file bug
	- found it to kill game performance on another monitor (likely multi-GPU buffer copy)
	- make dragged rooms stay where dragged a lot better
	- connections hard to see with long room names in the way (and maybe make room connections have dark "inside" inside the broader white outline)
	- color transitions based on logic (if it can be taken with the current loadout)
	- performance issues when rendering in cluster layout (perhaps push cluster motion (and DOM update plans?) to web workers)
	- when selecting a room, ability to zoom to it, or message that you haven't seen it
	- map wiggling bug
	- make it easier to find yourself
	- probably should make hub & distance the default view
	- show benches w/Benchwap mod names
	- ** "where am I?"
	- ** "it's lagging my computer" "this is pretty awful" - enough so I can see the framerate drop at 2x speed...
	- Confusion from elevators not being linked
	- somehow map stopped recording new transitions? Might be because they were reloading the map and the save data is stale bug.
	- room <-> bench routing
	- room icons
	- room search:
		- only show visible rooms in dropdown (but maybe we just make it easy to see in selection)
		- name search
