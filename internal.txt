	- xx main game performance issues
		- seems to be caused mostly by showing the map on a non-primary-GPU display

	- user-centric would be very useful, plus pick a room to route
		- maybe arrange nodes in circualr pattern radius is based on "distance" from user
	- hands-free follow me
	- some rooms show connected, but internally are divided (e.g. A-B and C-D okay, but A-C is never possible)
		- Ruins1_18
		- Fungus3_48
		- Maybe just have an in-game shortcut to add pins/tags to rooms and let the user deal with it how they'd like
	- hard to track rooms when they jitter on transition
	- xx it'd be nice to know which transitinos go to waht on a room
	- show what rooms you missed items in
	- maybe collapse 1 entrace/1 exit rooms "straight through"? or inline them a lot?
	- not stopping server causes hang on quit?


- Button to rearrange to be user-centric

- Button to enable following the user

- Show real room sizes and door positions
	- need to prebuild position metadata
		- script guid for door: 1c941bf77e19ad542aaf2777b2c75f81
		- don't know if we need to find real bounds, just use the doors?

- click to select,
	- pathfinding to selected room, https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.path looks like good lib for helping

- icons for rooms:
	- user-applied icons
	- all doors used
	- all items collected

- the inward jutter some nodes experience when we add data. What's causing that?







- Room link joints try to position to center of other room instead of its corresponding door
- Pathfinding to item in spoiler mode?
- Select room for name and stats (num transitions visited/unvisited, items found/not found (or count of not found if no spoilers))
- as you reveal the map, things end up in funny places, the hub isn't cenetered in island
- Sliders to adjust room align forces/radii

- zz Show real room icons

- show one-way transitions?
- Jumbled mess
	- tune door constraint, much stronger repulsion if inline on the wrong side, less force if off-axis at a distance
	- try turning off "keep apart" constraints for a warmup period then turn them back on
	- try sinking cross-island links to an outer circle, then jump to other islands from there?
	- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
		- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions


- Bugs
	- Doesn't work with fresh save file, have to exit and reload
	- reload page while save data is stale gives...stale save data  - seems to happen even if I pull data directly from the randomizer mod settings
