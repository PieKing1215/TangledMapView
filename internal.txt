(It's an ugly, jumbled mess)
- Island rework:
	- xx Pick island "hub" rooms based on number of connections of visited room. Most wins. Number is based on reasonable sizes (e.g. 20 rooms to an island)
	- xx gradient pathfind and tag all rooms with the island of the closest hub
	- xx two(+) simulations:
		- xx macro simulation, arranges islands only (so they don't overlap)
		- xx island simulations, arranges items within an island
	- xx figure out why we have orphans
		- xx we are considering all data when we crawl, but not making links for two adjacent visited rooms you haven't used the transition on yet
	- add cross-island link lines (dotted)
		- xx add
		- xx we have rooms adjacent to hubs...that aren't in the island and are semidistant form their hub
		- emphasize on hover
	- push to repo
	- instead of using link forces and trying to keep things on certain sides, make a force function that calculates an "ideal" position and pulls toward that
		- adjust radii as we get farther from the hub so it's easier to fit "impossible" room arrangements

- constrain islands to circles with dynamic and cross-simulation influenced radii?
	- copy forces to keep objects inside to push on the circle radius, counteract it with forces from the inter-island interactions

- Or, just go with only rendering nearby rooms for now?

- pathfinding to room/item, https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.path looks like good lib for helping

- Show roughly real room shapes

- deal with later:
	- isolated room groups that don't have an island hub won't appear
