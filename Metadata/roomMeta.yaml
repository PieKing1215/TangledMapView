# This file's a bunch of information about rooms in the game.
# It includes some common/friendly room names, information about split rooms
# (rooms with one or more transition that can never be reached from any other),
# stag stations, special transport (trams, elevators, etc.).
#
# If you think a different name is more suitable/recognizable by the
# community please let me know!
#
# It's hand-edited unlike most of the data files.
#
# And YAML...cuz...I'm already reading it for the scenes and I don't have to
# put in as many quotation marks as I do with JSON.
